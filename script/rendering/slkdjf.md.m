Objective:

I need assistance with optimizing a PixiJS application that renders a large grid of sprites.
Specifically, I want to implement custom shaders to handle sprite rendering and cropping directly on the GPU to maximize performance.

Background:

    Current Situation:
        The application displays a grid of cells (sv.cells), each representing a texture.
        Initially, masks were used to crop sprites to their cell dimensions, but this method was too slow due to the computational overhead of masks in PixiJS.
        I attempted to optimize by using texture frames (PIXI.Rectangle) to crop sprites, which improved performance but didn't fully meet the requirements.
        Now, I aim to achieve the highest possible performance by using custom shaders to handle the rendering and cropping on the GPU.

    Performance Goal:
        Achieve 60 frames per second (FPS) or higher.
        Efficiently render a large number of sprites (cells) with proper cropping, without the performance penalties associated with masks or excessive texture creation.

Technical Details:

    Environment:
        Using PixiJS (latest version as of October 2023).
        The application is built with the following structure:
            sv.pApp: The PixiJS application instance.
            sv.cells: An array holding cell data, including position and brightness.
            sv.circleGraphics.canvas: A canvas element used to generate textures.
            sv.customShapeGraphics.canvas: A canvas element used to generate textures.


    Existing Code:

    Here's the current updateCellData function after previous optimizations:

    javascript

export function updateCellData() {
  console.log("running updateCellData");
  let _imgs = Array.isArray(sv.animUnderImgs)
    ? sv.animUnderImgs
    : [sv.animUnderImgs]; // Ensure _imgs is always an array

  const p = sv.p;
  sv.cells = []; // Clear and redefine the array

  // Preprocess images
  const processedImages = _imgs.map((img) => {
    const processed = img.get();
    processed.filter(p.GRAY);
    return processed;
  });

  let gridIndex = 0;

  for (let y = 0; y < sv.rowCount; y++) {
    for (let x = 0; x < sv.colCount; x++) {
      let xPos = x * sv.cellW;
      let yPos = y * sv.cellH;

      let brightnessValues = processedImages.map((image) => {
        let cell = image.get(xPos, yPos, sv.cellW, sv.cellH);
        return calculateAverageBrightness(p, cell);
      });

      // Create cell once
      sv.cells[gridIndex++] = {
        gridIndex,
        currentImgIndex: 0,
        brightness: brightnessValues,
        x: xPos,
        y: yPos,
        width: sv.cellW,
        height: sv.cellH,
      };
    }
  }

  sv.pApp.renderer.resize(sv.gridW, sv.gridH);

  const _cCanv = sv.circleGraphics.canvas;
  const _sCanv = sv.customShapeGraphics.canvas;

  // Create ImageSource from canvases
  const cImageSource = new ImageSource({ resource: _cCanv });
  const sImageSource = new ImageSource({ resource: _sCanv });
  sv.cTex = new Texture({ source: cImageSource });
  sv.sTex = new Texture({ source: sImageSource });

  for (let n = 0; n < sv.totalCells; n++) {
    const cell = sv.cells[n];

    // Create a texture frame for the cell to avoid using masks
    const cellFrame = new Rectangle(cell.x, cell.y, cell.width, cell.height);
    const circleTexture = new Texture(sv.cTex.baseTexture, cellFrame);
    const shapeTexture = new Texture(sv.sTex.baseTexture, cellFrame);

    const cSprite = new Sprite(circleTexture);
    cSprite.x = cell.x;
    cSprite.y = cell.y;
    const sSprite = new Sprite(shapeTexture);
    sSprite.x = cell.x;
    sSprite.y = cell.y;
    const sSprite2 = new Sprite(shapeTexture);
    sSprite2.x = cell.x;
    sSprite2.y = cell.y;

    sv.pApp.stage.addChild(cSprite);
    sv.pApp.stage.addChild(sSprite);
    sv.pApp.stage.addChild(sSprite2);

    sv.circles.push({
      i: n,
      sprite: cSprite,
      originalX: cell.x,
      originalY: cell.y,
    });
    sv.shapes.push({
      i: n,
      sprite: sSprite,
      originalX: cell.x,
      originalY: cell.y,
    });
    sv.shapes2.push({
      i: n,
      sprite: sSprite2,
      originalX: cell.x,
      originalY: cell.y,
    });
  }
}

    Challenges:
        Using texture frames improved performance but didn't fully replicate the desired visual effect because the sprites weren't being cropped correctly.
        Masks provided the correct visual result but were too slow for real-time rendering with many cells.
        Need a method to crop sprites efficiently while maintaining high performance.

Request:

    Main Goal:
        Implement custom shaders in PixiJS to handle sprite rendering and cropping on the GPU, eliminating the need for masks or per-cell textures.

    Specific Requirements:
        Provide guidance and code examples on how to create and integrate custom vertex and fragment shaders in PixiJS for this purpose.
        Explain how to pass the necessary uniforms and attributes to the shaders.
        Ensure that the solution scales well with a large number of sprites (cells).
        Maintain or improve the current FPS (aiming for 60 FPS or higher).

    Additional Context:
        The sprites represent cells in a grid layout, each needing to display the texture (sv.cTex).
        Each cell has its own position (x, y) and size (width, height).
        The application will need to adjust sprite properties like x position based on data from sv.cells.

Questions to Address:

    Shader Implementation:
        How can I write custom shaders in PixiJS to handle the rendering and cropping of sprites directly on the GPU?
        What modifications are needed in the rendering loop to use these shaders?

    Passing Data to Shaders:
        How do I pass per-sprite data (e.g., position, size, texture coordinates) to the shaders?
        How can I efficiently manage uniforms and attributes for a large number of sprites?

    Performance Optimization:
        What best practices should I follow when writing shaders to ensure maximum performance?
        Are there any limitations or considerations when using custom shaders in PixiJS that I should be aware of?

    Integration with PixiJS:
        How do I integrate the custom shaders with PixiJS's rendering pipeline?
        Do I need to create a custom PIXI.Mesh or can I modify PIXI.Sprite to use the shaders?

Desired Outcome:

    A working example or template of how to implement and integrate custom shaders for sprite rendering and cropping in PixiJS.
    An explanation of how the solution works and why it improves performance.
    Any recommendations for further optimizations or best practices.
