••• TO DO:
• PRIORITY 1
Have an image already pre-calculated for default,
instead of spending time calculating the same image on each load.

Have a processing / loading screen, prefereably one that displays a grid
and fills in each cell as they is being evaluated.

Fix the bug that happens when changing from 2 images to 1 image at runtime.


Implement proper resizing
