good morning, 
to finish this up,
we need to do the following:
    • create simple loading animation
        • show and hide this
    • implement support for 1 or 2 images
    • re-implement resizing
    • re-connect the gui
    • re-implement recording
    • a stable, centered viewport for the sketch
Nice to haves:
    • make sure the cells have clean lines at 100% and 0% brightness
