good morning, 
to finish this up,
we need to do the following:
    ~~~~create simple loading animation~~~~
       ~~~~show and hide this when we are updating the grid~~~~
    • re-connect the gui
        ~~~~grid resolution~~~~
        • screenshot
        • screen recording
        • manual scale
        • speed
        • noise offset
        • contrast
        • clip outliers
        • scale dynamically
        • start invisible
        • the new thing, the 3 start point (shader) uniforms
    • implement support for 1 or 2 images
    • re-implement resizing
    • a stable, centered viewport for the sketch
Nice to haves:
    • make sure the cells have clean lines at 100% and 0% brightness
