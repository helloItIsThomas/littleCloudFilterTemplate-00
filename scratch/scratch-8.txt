good morning, 
to finish this up,
we need to do the following:
    ~~~~create simple loading animation~~~~
       ~~~~show and hide this when we are updating the grid~~~~
    • re-connect the gui
        ~~~~grid resolution~~~~
        ~~~~manual scale~~~~
        • implement support for 1 or 2 images
            • single image mode
                replace custom tiles with my svg's
                ~~~~support image with any aspect ratio~~~~
                ~~~~contrast~~~~
                • start invisible
                • scale dynamically
                • clip outliers
        • screenshot
                                                    https://pixijs.com/8.x/examples/advanced/screen-shot?_highlight=scre
        • screen recording
        • speed
        • noise offset
        • color
        ~~~~the new thing, the 3 start point (shader) uniforms~~~~
    ~~~~re-implement resizing~~~~
    ~~~~a stable, centered viewport for the sketch~~~~
Nice to haves:
    • make sure the cells have clean lines at 100% and 0% brightness

Currently, the pixi app is resizing to fit the bodyRightDiv.
This means that when I screenshot the pixi app,
it has some excess on the edges.
I either want to resize the pixi app to fit the current image,
or I want to find a way to trim that excess from the screenshot.
The other issue is,
the icons for both single and mult img frags are not scaling correctly.
They should be scaling based on the aspect ratio of the active image.

The problem seems to be that i am basing the grid off the images,
but I am resizing the images after I am creating the grid.
WHY isnt the gridW or H changing when I resize the window?
Because it seems i am changing the width and height of a copy of the images,
not the original images.
