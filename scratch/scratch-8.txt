good morning, 
to finish this up,
we need to do the following:
    ~~~~create simple loading animation~~~~
       ~~~~show and hide this when we are updating the grid~~~~
    ~~~~re-connect the gui~~~~
        ~~~~grid resolution~~~~
        ~~~~manual scale~~~~
        ~~~~implement support for 1 or 2 images~~~~
        • make sure the single frag shader is picking the right icons from the atlas, verify with grad.png
            • single image mode
                ~~~~replace custom tiles with my png's~~~~
                ~~~~support image with any aspect ratio~~~~
                ~~~~contrast~~~~
                ~~~~scale dynamically~~~~
                • start invisible
                • clip outliers
                • the new thing, the 3 start point (shader) uniforms •
        • make screenshot and screenrecording large
        ~~~~screenshot~~~~
        ~~~~screen recording~~~~
        • fix crop for screenshot and screen recording
        • speed
        • noise offset
        • color
    ~~~~re-implement resizing~~~~
    ~~~~a stable, centered viewport for the sketch~~~~
Nice to haves:
    • make sure the cells have clean lines at 100% and 0% brightness
