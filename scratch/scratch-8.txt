    • updateClock() is happening without regard to either our recording ticker nor drawing ticker.
    It therefore is also not paying attention to sv.speed.
    We need to either use something other than gsap, or we need to make the gsap .to lockstep with our tickers.

on load sometimes:
    Unhandled Promise Rejection: TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'imgs[0].width')

    • figure out how we are handling 2 images of different sizes.
        - we aren't. 
    • make sure the cells have clean lines at 100% and 0% brightness in single image mode.
    • implement noise offset in both image modes so they wrap cleanly.
        - got rid of noise offset in all modes.

    SINGLE IMAGE MODE
        • figure out how to implement 1-3 threshes for single image mode.
        • re-implement indexing for svg loading, so they are all placed in the list in order.
        • verify single.frag with grad.png
        • fix screen recording initialization issue.
            ( when the app in the background goes from white to not white, this is probably the loading screen being hidden )
            No idea why this is happening. 
            Maybe the reason the svg icons are loading low res when we await updateSvgIcons() in startRecording() is because we are not waiting for the images to load inside updateSvgIcons().
