good morning, 
to finish this up,
we need to do the following:
    ~~~~create simple loading animation~~~~
       ~~~~show and hide this when we are updating the grid~~~~
    • re-connect the gui
        ~~~~grid resolution~~~~
        ~~~~manual scale~~~~
        • implement support for 1 or 2 images
            • single image mode
I need a single way to flag what mode we are in.
                replace custom tiles with my svg's
                ~~~~support image with any aspect ratio~~~~
                ~~~~contrast~~~~
                • start invisible
                • scale dynamically
                • clip outliers
        • screenshot
                                                    https://pixijs.com/8.x/examples/advanced/screen-shot?_highlight=scre
        • screen recording
        • speed
        • noise offset
        • color
        ~~~~the new thing, the 3 start point (shader) uniforms~~~~
    ~~~~re-implement resizing~~~~
    ~~~~a stable, centered viewport for the sketch~~~~
Nice to haves:
    • make sure the cells have clean lines at 100% and 0% brightness
